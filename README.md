Shortly after I started learning to code, it dawned on me that *An Improviser's Operating System* could be easily reproduced programmatically: the book is simply a list of the 2,048 possible combinations of a chromatic scale.  Later, while learning about d3.js, I thought it might be interesting to visualize the book, so I gave it a shot.  The visual I ended up with is a sort of binary heat map.  Scales are represented by columns, made up of black and white rectangles, showing the presence and absence of intervals respectively.  Scales are grouped by length, in ascending order, so their distribution by length is clearly visible.  A scale can be heard by clicking on it.  Clicking row labels (P1, m2, etc.) filters in/out scales that contain an interval.  Mousewheel zooming is also possible.
