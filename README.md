Shortly after I started learning to code, it dawned on me that *An Improviser's Operating System* could be easily reproduced programmatically: the book is simply a list of the 2048 possible combinations of a chromatic scale.  Later, while learning about d3.js, I thought it might be interesting to visualize the book, and put together this project.  The visual I ended up with is a sort of binary heat map.  It depicts the algorithm used to generate the scales themselves.  It also clearly shows the distribution of scales by length, since scales are grouped by length, in ascending order from left to right.  Scales are represented by columns, made up of black and white rectangles, showing the presence and absence of intervals respectively.  A scale can be heard by clicking on it.  Clicking row labels (P1, m2, etc.) filters in/out scales that contain a given interval.  Mousewheel zooming is also possible.
